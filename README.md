# Ticket Sales Pipeline

In this mini-project, a data pipeline that ingests online ticket sales data from vendors into a ticket system database was created. A MySQL database and Python was used to develop the pipeline.

## Prerequisites

The db_auth.xml file needs to have the correct arguments in order to connect to your MySQL database. Please also input the path to where you downloaded the sample csv for data ingestion. To set up the database in MySQL, run the ticketsales_ddl.sql file. Once these steps are complete, the pipeline.py file can be run.
